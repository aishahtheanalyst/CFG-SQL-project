## Code First Girls: Introduction to Data and SQL

I completed the Introduction to Data and SQL kickstart course run by Code First Girl in April 2022. It ran for 8 weeks, remotely with approximately 20 other women and non-binary people.

In this course we used MySQL and created a project either individually or with 2 other people to present to our instructors in the penultimate week of the course.

Topics covered in the course included but was not limited to:

* Creating, storing and managing databases
* Queries with select statements, having, group by
* Subqueries
* Joins and unions
* Stored functions and procedures
* Triggers, events and backups
* Database design and visualisations

## Course Project

My project consisted of 6 tables analysing female kpop idols and girlgroups alongside their first album sales and most recent album sales as of June 2022.

As it was my first ever project, I came across many obstacles and at the time of writing this, I know there are many things I would have changed. For example, I manually researched and typed every single album, female idol, group etc which took a while: I should have used web scraping or something simpler such as sourcing an already established database and exporting it to Excel. I still wanted to share this project to eventually come back to and update as I continue to learn about SQL in my data analysis journey.

The project was presented to the group and instructors gave us constructive feedback - we obtained a certificate upon completion of the course.
